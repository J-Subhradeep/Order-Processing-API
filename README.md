# Order-Processing-API
# 🛒 Kafka-based Order Processing System using Kotlin & Spring Boot

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a microservices-based architecture using **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous communication between two Kotlin-based Spring Boot services:
- `OrderAPI` – Handles incoming order requests.
- `OrderProcessorService` – Processes and stores the order data.

Kafka is used as the messaging middleware with **random partition selection** for improved performance and load balancing.
